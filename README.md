# Coordinates

Rodzyanko Dobromil Vyacheslavovich, a lazy and greedy man, has gone to the park. The park is from above in the form of a Cartesian coordinate plane. Radzinka sits at a point in the park at xxx and yyy and stares at the horizon (to the positive yyy). Radzinka's friend, who is in the coordinates x1x_1x1 and y1y_1y1, calls him. Radzin wants to turn his head, look at him and answer. But because of his laziness, he wants to turn his head in the direction that has the least amount of rotation. Help him choose the right direction.
